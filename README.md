# yelp_api

The idea of this code is consuming Yelp api to compare the average rating between McDonald's restaurants and all fast food restaurants in Washington DC.

It was did it in Python3 but, for a better performance, it will be reformulated in NodeJS, due to the several calls you have to make to Yelp api for DC restaurants average.
